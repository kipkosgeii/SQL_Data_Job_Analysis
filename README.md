## Background

In today’s data-driven world, the role of a Data has become crucial across industries. With businesses relying on data for strategic decisions, the demand for Analysts has grown significantly. I am eager to pursue a career in this field, recognizing its importance and potential for growth.

To effectively analyze and interpret data, I have chosen to focus on SQL (Structured Query Language) due to its widespread use and versatility in managing relational databases. Mastering SQL will enable me to extract valuable insights from large datasets, a key skill for any Analyst role.

Through this project, I aimed to answer several key questions using SQL queries:

1. **What are the top-paying Data Analyst jobs?**
2. **What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?**
3. **What skills are most in demand for Data Analysts?**
4. **Which skills are associated with higher salaries?**
5. **What are the most optimal skills to learn for a Data Analyst career?**

The insights gained from this analysis increased my confidence and improved my analysitcal skill, with high demand, competitive salaries, and clear opportunities for growth. With SQL as a key tool, I’m excited to contribute to this dynamic industry.

# Tools I used 

1. **SQL**:
 - **Role**: The main tool for managing and querying relational databases is SQL (Structured Query Language). I was able to create intricate queries for data extraction, manipulation, and analysis.
   **Purpose**: It was utilized for data aggregations, dataset queries, and insight extraction.

2. **VS Code (Visual Studio Code)**: - **Position**: Programming languages and extensions are supported by VS Code, a flexible code editor.
   **Intention**: used for managing project files, creating and testing SQL queries, and integrating version control.

3. **Role**: **PostgreSQL**: Strong and scalable, PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).
   **Intention**: functioned as the database system through which I managed and saved my datasets, ran SQL queries, and carried out data analysis.

4. **GitHub** is a platform thas facilitates documenting, store project files, keep track of modifications, and record project progress.

I was able to successfully manage my work and finish my data analysis job thanks in large part to each of these tools.



# The Analysis
# What I learned 
 **SQL**

I now understand SQL much better. as a tool for relational database management and querying. It gave me the ability to create and run queries for data extraction, manipulation, and analysis.

- It has enhanced and established the basis for comprehending how to carry out intricate data operations, such as:
- **Subqueries**: Made it possible for me to retrieve and filter data in multiple steps using a single query.
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: By establishing reusable query components, queries were made more readable and organized.
- **Features of Advanced SQL** : enabled me to leverage window functions, carry out intricate joins, use indexing to improve queries, and compile information for insightful analysis.


# Conclusion 

My knowledge and understanding of SQL have grown significantly as a result of this project, which has improved my ability to query and manage relational databases. I've learned how to use advanced SQL capabilities like subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs), execute complex data operations, and effectively manage my workload by using SQL, Visual Studio Code, PostgreSQL, and GitHub.

This experience has been quite helpful in comprehending SQL's useful applications and function in data analysis. The tools gave me a solid framework for honing my abilities, and now that I have them, I can handle issues involving data analysis.

I want to express my gratitude to Luke Barouse in particular for all of his help and advice with this project. His assistance and knowledge were really helpful to my learning.
